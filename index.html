                <p>The objective of this project is to develop a wireless automatic data logging device for breath based medical research. 
                    By utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU) with FreeRTOS operating system and a Notecarrier AF for cellular communication, the project aims to create a robust and reliable platform for remote breath data collection. 
                    The purpose is to provide an efficient solution that overcomes the limitations of previous iteration which utilized 3G protocol which has been phased out, having poor connectivity and is not usable anymore.</p>

                <p>This initiative delves into the foundational principles underlying the development of contemporary home automation systems. 
                    The prototype serves as a noteworthy initial example, illustrating the remote operation of devices. 
                    Utilizing the on-board HC05 Bluetooth module for seamless wireless serial communication, this system transmits serial data to an Android application. 
                    The Android app, in turn, responds by toggling various home peripherals.
                    <br> <br>This strategic approach aims to transform conventional, non-smart peripherals into intelligent, remotely controllable devices. 
                    The overarching objective of the project is to empower users to convert their non-smart appliances into smart, operable devices through seamless and efficient wireless communication.

                <p>The project demonstrates a design and working model of RRR (three revolute joint) robotic arm which has 3 degrees of freedom. 
                    The arm consists of three rotary joints which are controlled by three servo motors. 
                    These servo motors are responsible for the movement of the arm. These robotic arms can be used in a variety of applications, including manufacturing, assembly, and research. 
                    
                   <br> <br> The goal of this project is to implement the Forward and Inverse Kinematics using equations, translating those equations in the language which the microcontroller can understand and uploading the code to the microcontroller.
